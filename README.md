This repository is my learning log and study notes for **Huawei Collaboration technologies**.

The focus is on configuration, setup, and usage of Huawei lab tools such as **IdeaHub, Box 610, Camera C200**, and other collaboration endpoints.

The goal is to keep my notes organized, share my study plan, and document key concepts for future reference.
