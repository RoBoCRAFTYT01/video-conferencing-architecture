# ðŸ“Š Huawei Collaboration Diagrams

This folder contains all diagrams related to **Huawei Collaboration** concepts, architecture, and procedures.  
The folder is split into two parts to keep editable sources separate from exported images.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

```plaintext
diagrams/
â”œâ”€â”€ source/        # Editable diagram source files (.drawio, .vsdx, .svg)
â”œâ”€â”€ exports/       # Exported images (.png / .jpg) for embedding in notes & study plan
â””â”€â”€ README.md      # This file
```

**âœ… Key Point:** Always keep both source (`editable`) and exports (`viewable`) so you never lose the ability to update diagrams later.
